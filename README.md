# Smart Attendance AI-Based System
Project Overview
The Smart Attendance AI-Based System is an intelligent facial recognition solution developed using Python and OpenCV that revolutionizes how organizations manage attendance tracking. This project directly addresses the persistent challenges of traditional attendance systems—manual errors, time consumption, proxy attendance (buddy punching), and administrative overhead—by leveraging artificial intelligence and computer vision to create a seamless, contactless, and automated experience.
The Problem
Traditional attendance methods suffer from fundamental limitations. In educational settings, teachers waste valuable instructional time calling names and marking attendance manually—often 5-10 minutes per class. Paper-based systems are susceptible to illegible entries, human error, and fraudulent markings. More critically, proxy attendance remains rampant, where one person marks attendance for an absent peer, completely undermining record integrity.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine. ``` https://github.com/mrkyaing/smart-attandance-ai-based-system ```
2. Install the required packages using ```pip install -r requirements.txt```.
3. Download the dlib models from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12It2jeNQOxwStBxtagL1vvIJokoz-DL4?usp=sharing and place the data folder inside the repo

## Usage
1. Collect the Faces Dataset by running ``` python faces_register.py``` .
2. Convert the dataset into ```python features_extraction.py```.
3. To take the attendance run ```python take_attendance.py``` .
4. Check the Database by ```python app.py```.
